## üìò Kubernetes Pod Resource Concepts & Debugging

### üß± Pod Definition Example
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: simple-webapp-color
  labels:
    name: simple-webapp-color
spec:
  containers:
    - name: simple-webapp-color
      image: simple-webapp-color
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "4Gi"
          cpu: "2"
```

### üß† What does 4Gi mean?
In the YAML file, 4Gi refers to a memory request of 4 gibibytes (GiB), which is a unit of digital information storage.  
  * `GiB (Gibibyte)` is based on powers of 2, where:
    * 1 GiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes (2^30 bytes).

This is different from GB (gigabyte), which is based on powers of 10 and is commonly used in storage devices (1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes).


```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "4Gi"
    cpu: "2"
```

* `memory`: "4Gi" means the pod requests 4 GiB of memory. Kubernetes uses this value to ensure that the pod has at least this amount of memory available on the node where it's running.
* `cpu`: "2" means the pod requests 2 CPUs (or 2 cores). Kubernetes treats 1 CPU as equivalent to:  
  - 1 vCPU in AWS  
  - 1 core in GCP  
  - 1 logical CPU (hyper-thread) in Azure

In summary, `4Gi` specifies that the pod is requesting 4 GiB of memory from the Kubernetes cluster.

ü§î‚ùì**Question**: "Note that CPU values can be fractional (e.g., 0.1 or 100m, where "m" stands for milli). One CPU represents one vCPU, making it equivalent to 1 AWS vCPU, 1 GCP core, 1 Azure core, or 1 hyper-thread on other platforms." What does that mean?

‚úÖ **Answer**:
This statement explains how CPU resources are allocated and represented in Kubernetes and how the CPU units relate to cloud provider resources.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what it means:

1. **CPU values can be fractional**:
* Fractional CPU means that you can request and limit CPU resources in smaller-than-1 increments, such as 0.1 or 0.5. This allows more fine-grained control over CPU allocation.
* For example, a request of 0.1 CPU means the container will use 10% of a CPU's capacity.

2. **100m (milli) for CPU**:  
* "m" stands for milli, which means one-thousandth of a CPU. So 100m represents 0.1 CPU (100 milli CPUs).
* In this case, 100m means you're requesting 10% of a full CPU core.

3. **1 CPU represents 1 vCPU**:
* 1 CPU in Kubernetes is equivalent to 1 virtual CPU (vCPU), which is a logical processor in a virtualized environment.

This is important for understanding how the CPU resource requests map to the physical resources available on the underlying infrastructure.

4. **1 vCPU in AWS, GCP, Azure, or other platforms**:
* 1 vCPU corresponds to a virtual CPU in cloud environments like AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. These virtual CPUs are typically allocated to virtual machines (VMs) running on physical servers.
* In most cloud environments, the vCPU is roughly equivalent to a hyper-thread, which is a logical processor in a physical CPU core.

**To summarize**:  
* 1 Kubernetes CPU ‚âà
    - 1 vCPU in AWS, GCP, or Azure
    - 1 hyper-thread on multi-threaded CPUs

**Key Takeaways**:
* Fractional CPU allows precise control of how much CPU a container will use.
* 1 CPU in Kubernetes is typically equivalent to 1 virtual CPU (vCPU) on most cloud platforms, such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, and is generally equal to 1 hyper-thread on platforms that support multi-threading in CPUs.


### üßÆ Fractional CPU values
| Value  | Meaning               |
|--------|-----------------------|
| 0.1    | 10% of a CPU          |
| 100m   | 100 milliCPU = 0.1 CPU|
| 500m   | Half of a CPU core    |
