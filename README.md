## Kubernetes Notes

This repository contains my personal notes while learning and working with Kubernetes.

## Why I Made This
I'm passionate about cloud-native technologies and these notes are part of my preparation for the  [CKAD](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/) certification. These notes help me consolidate understanding of Kubernetes core concepts and I hope they're useful for you too.
